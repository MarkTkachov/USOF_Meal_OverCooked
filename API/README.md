# USOF Backend

Made By Mark "mtkachov" Tkachov

It's a backend web API for a StackOverflow-style forum/website.
It makes registration, posting, commenting, liking and adding categories to posts possible.
It also has an Admin panel for CRUD operations on database.  

It sends data in a JSON format that can be seen later.

## Requirements
- NodeJS with ESM support
- NPM
- MySQL Database
  
## How to run
1. Configure db_config.json by setting your database name, user credentials and MySQL Server port (3036 Default)
2. Run "npm i" to install node modules
3. Run "npm run start" or "node index" in the usof_backend directory
4. Application will run on port 3000
   
## Admin panel
1. Configure "db_config.json" (Step 1 from How to Run)
2. Run "npm i" to install node modules
3. Run "npm run start" or "node index" in the admin_panel directory
4. Admin panel will run on port 3001

If no admins are registered and Admin Panel access is required, "node unauthed" will start it without authentication
